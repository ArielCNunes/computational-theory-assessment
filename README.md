# Computational Theory Assessment

## This repository holds a Jupyter notebook containing all five problems in the computational theory assessment.

### Problem I: Binary Words and Operations
Implement certain functions in Python. Use numpy to ensure that all variables and values are treated as 32-bit integers. These functions are defined in the Secure Hash Standard.
