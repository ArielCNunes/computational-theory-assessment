# SHA-256 Hash Algorithm Implementation Assessment

This repository contains solutions to five problems focusing on different aspects of the Secure Hash Standard (SHA-256), as specified in NIST FIPS 180-4.

## Problems Overview

1. **Binary Words and Operations** - Implementation of SHA-256 logical functions
2. **Fractional Parts of Cube Roots** - Generation of SHA-256 constants from prime cube roots
3. **Padding** - Message padding according to SHA-256 specification
4. **Hashes** - Core SHA-256 hash computation function
5. **Passwords** - Password cracking and security analysis

## Getting Started
