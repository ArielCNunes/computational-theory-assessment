# Computational Theory Assessment

### This repository holds a Jupyter notebook containing all five problems in the computational theory assessment.

### Problem 1: Binary Words and Operations
Implement certain functions in Python. Use numpy to ensure that all variables and values are treated as 32-bit integers. These functions are defined in the Secure Hash Standard.

### Problem 2: Fractional Parts of Cube Roots
Use numpy to calculate the constants listed at the bottom of page 11 of the Secure Hash Standard, following the given steps. These are the first 32 bits of the fractional parts of the cube roots of the first 64 prime numbers.

### Problem 3: Padding
Write a generator function block_parse(msg) that processes messages according to section 5.1.1 and 5.2.1 of the Secure Hash Standard. The function should accept a bytes object called msg.

### Problem 4: Hashes
Write a function hash(current, block) that calculates the next hash value given the current hash value and the next message block according to section 6.2.2 SHA-256 Hash Computation on page 22 of the Secure Hash Standard.

### Problem 5: Passwords
Determine the passwords and explain how you found SHA-256 hashes of three common passwords that have been hashed using one pass of the SHA-256 algorithm.
